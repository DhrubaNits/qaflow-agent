# Coding Agent Guide

## Prerequisites

Install the CLI (one-time):
```bash
uv tool install google-agents-cli
```

## Project Context

QAFlow Agent is an AI-powered human-in-the-loop QA workflow assistant.

The agent supports the QA lifecycle from requirement intake to release readiness, including requirement gap analysis, test scenario generation, test case writing, peer review, risk and coverage analysis, failure triage, fix recommendation, release readiness, and final QA reporting.

The project uses Gemini, Google ADK, Google Cloud Run, Google Agent Runtime, MongoDB MCP, MongoDB Atlas, and Google Secret Manager.

MongoDB MCP is used as the persistent QA memory and RAG layer. QAFlow stores requirements, gap analysis, test scenarios, test cases, peer review notes, execution summaries, release readiness, and final reports in MongoDB Atlas.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Understand Requirements
Before writing any code, understand the project's requirements, constraints, and success criteria.

### Phase 2: Build and Implement
Implement agent logic in `qaflow/`. Use `agents-cli playground` for interactive testing. Iterate based on user feedback.

### Phase 3: The Evaluation Loop (Main Iteration Phase)
Start with 1-2 eval cases, run `agents-cli eval run`, iterate. Expect 5-10+ iterations. See the **Evaluation Guide** for metrics, evalset schema, LLM-as-judge config, and common gotchas.

### Phase 4: Pre-Deployment Tests
Run `uv run pytest tests/unit tests/integration`. Fix issues until all tests pass.

### Phase 5: Deploy to Dev
**Requires explicit human approval.** Run `agents-cli deploy` only after user confirms. See the **Deployment Guide** for details.

### Phase 6: Production Deployment
Ask the user: Option A (simple single-project) or Option B (full CI/CD pipeline with `agents-cli infra cicd`).

## Development Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `agents-cli playground` | Interactive local testing |
| `uv run pytest tests/unit tests/integration` | Run unit and integration tests |
| `agents-cli eval run` | Run evaluation against evalsets |
| `agents-cli lint` | Check code quality |
| `agents-cli infra single-project` | Set up project infrastructure (Terraform) |
| `agents-cli deploy` | Deploy to dev |
| `agents-cli scaffold enhance` | Add deployment target or CI/CD to project |
| `agents-cli scaffold upgrade` | Upgrade project to latest version |

## Operational Guidelines for Coding Agents

- **Code preservation**: Only modify code directly targeted by the user's request. Preserve all surrounding code, config values (e.g., `model`), comments, and formatting.
- **NEVER change the model** unless explicitly asked.
- **Model 404 errors**: Fix `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` (e.g., `global` instead of `us-central1`), not the model name.
- **ADK tool imports**: Import the tool instance, not the module: `from google.adk.tools.load_web_page import load_web_page`
- **Run Python with `uv`**: `uv run python script.py`. Run `agents-cli install` first.
- **Stop on repeated errors**: If the same error appears 3+ times, fix the root cause instead of retrying.
- **Terraform conflicts** (Error 409): Use `terraform import` instead of retrying creation.
